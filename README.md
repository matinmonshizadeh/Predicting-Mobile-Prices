## Introduction
In this project, we extracted data from an e-commerce site using the Selenium library in Python. After collecting the data, we performed data cleaning and transformation to prepare it for analysis. We then trained and evaluated a linear regression model to predict mobile prices. Finally, we developed a user-friendly application using the Tkinter library, which allows users to predict the price of a mobile phone based on inputs like Brand, SIM count, Storage, RAM, and color.

Our project contains these steps:
- 1.1 Data Collection
- 1.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation
- 2.1 Linear Regression Model
- 3.1 Price Prediction

## Conclusion

According to the final results, we can conclude that one reason the model did not perform well is that the linear regression model is not suitable for this dataset, and other models should be considered. Additionally, while we are not certain, there is also a possibility that the site from which we extracted the data was not suitable for our project.
